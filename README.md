# Whisk 3D (Ex Blendersito)

[![es](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-es-yellow.svg)](/README.es.md)

Whisk3D is a fully home-grown 3D creation tool developed from scratch, with the goal of bringing modeling, rendering, animation and game development to any device — even those considered “obsolete.”

It began as a lightweight Blender-like tool made for Nokia phones, but today it has evolved into something much more: a creative environment focused on low-poly aesthetics and the visual identity of PlayStation, Dreamcast and retro PC graphics. Whisk3D prioritizes speed, accessibility and fun over unnecessary complexity.

The MIT license allows anyone to use it freely to create games, commercial, educational or artistic projects, and even fork or expand the tool without restrictions.

It is still in pre-alpha — an early glimpse of something that is growing — yet it already carries a clear vision: anyone should be able to model, animate, design, render and develop 3D games without needing modern hardware or facing overwhelming learning curves.

Whisk3D is built on a simple philosophy: hardware shouldn’t die because software did. I want to prove that planned obsolescence can be reversed through code, and that a machine labeled as “old” can continue creating, imagining and producing new content.

The project — and the games made with it — aim to be sustained through voluntary donations, not microtransactions, intrusive ads, loot boxes, or systems designed to manipulate or create artificial engagement.
Whisk3D does NOT install background services, track users, sell data, require an account or demand permanent connectivity. We respect creators and players.

We want to return control of software back to its users, democratize creation, and allow new generations to experiment with 3D without technical or financial barriers.

## Instalation: 
You need to have PyS60 installed, or it won’t run. If you don’t have it, I’ve included the installer in the "Dependencies" folder on GitHub. The latest version is always in the "sis" folder as "Whisk3D_gcce.sisx", though the latest version might not always work properly. The more polished versions are always in the "releases" folder, with their date and a name referencing the demos I show on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dante_leoncini?igsh=MWpjYTd5YzU5dTBkNg==).

The program isn’t production-ready and has several known bugs. It’s constantly evolving, and I’m always adding or removing features. For example, the 3D modeling feature was removed in the latest versions, but if you use versions like Whisk3D_gcce_beta_24-08-15_FERNET.sisx, it was still available.

Finally, if the installer fails, it’s likely you’ll need to hack your phone to bypass Symbian’s restrictions on certificates. Here’s a video showing how to do it: [tutorial hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJJICzbk3TA)

## Clarifications:
1. Not a port: This program does not share any code with the original Blender.
2. Basic functionality: The program is basic, and some media have exaggerated its current capabilities.
3. Future updates: The ability to model, render, animate, and more is in development. Updates will be shared on social media.
4. Planned obsolescence: The project's goal is to highlight the planned obsolescence of phones, both those from 18 years ago and current models. I aim to generate consumer demand for more sustainable and durable phones, reducing the vast amount of electronic waste. This would also help more people access technology through the recycling of these old devices.
5. Knowledge in computing: We want to highlight the general lack of knowledge in computing. It shouldn't be surprising that Whisk 3D works on a Nokia N95, a phone that was top-of-the-line in its time, comparable to today's iPhone 15 Pro Max. I want to make it clear that with 300 MHz and 128 MB of RAM, tasks that today require phones with 8 GB of RAM and multicore processors can be performed.
6. Use of the Blender logo: The Blender logo belongs to the Blender Foundation. I would like to discuss with the foundation the possibility of splitting the project into two: one entirely free as a 3D game engine with its own identity, and another that can be part of the Blender Foundation, using its logo and assets to avoid multiple clones of the project (as happens with Linux distributions). It would also be interesting if Whisk 3D could become compatible with the traditional Blender. The idea is to create something that adds value. "The Freedom to Create". Blender does a great job in this regard, and Whisk3D is just a way to allow more people to enter this wonderful world.
7. Rendering and ray tracing: Whisk 3D can already perform renderings. Rendering, in computing terms, is the process of generating an image from a 2D or 3D model. While I haven't implemented ray tracing yet, the Nokia N95 is capable of it through its CPU and FPU (Floating Point Unit). In movies like Terminator 2 and Jurassic Park, SGI Onyx computers from 1993 were used. The Nokia N95, released in 2007, has 14 years of difference and is comparable in terms of power. It is concerning that so many people are surprised that an old phone can perform rendering.
8. Graphics performance: Whisk 3D runs smoothly thanks to the N95's hardware graphics acceleration (PowerVR MBX Lite) and its FPU, which allows it to handle complex 3D models like Arthur Morgan from Red Dead Redemption 2.

9. Project compatibility: This project works on all Nokia s60v3 devices. However, many phones, including later models, lack graphics acceleration due to Nokia's poor decision to save money by removing this feature. Although these phones may seem faster on paper than the N95, they are slower and more economical in practice due to the lack of graphics acceleration.

## About Blender
I am quite indignant about the many negative comments towards Blender, calling it heavy and inefficient on their computers. Blender is an extremely powerful program and can still run on fairly modest PC configurations. I've been using it for years and it's a software I love. You can even download older versions of Blender that work very well on older computers. I've used modern versions that also run excellently on computers from 10-15 years ago, solely with CPU graphics acceleration.

I highly recommend using Linux, installing an SSD in your PCs, and optimizing your projects according to your hardware and needs. You'll see that it's possible to work with old hardware without any issues.

## Thank You!
Thank you to everyone who shared the project. I hope this effort helps raise awareness and urge companies to manufacture more durable and sustainable phones.

#Thanks Marcig for the new Name!
(Currently is not support for s60v5 aka Symbian belle. But in theory is not hard to achieve)

[Primera Demo en Video](https://youtu.be/dMe-Vit5OT0)

This program is optimized to run on a Nokia N95-3 with 128mb of ram.
It can work in other Nokia's s60v3 with 64mb or less, but with the mayority has not graphic acceleration, it may not run as well as seen on the demos.

Notes: it's necessary to have python installed in order to run! (pys60 2.0.0)
